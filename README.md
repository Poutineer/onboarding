# onboarding

This will serve as a guide for onboarding new people to the project. Before we get two deep a new member must understand three things:

  0. We all have jobs doing something else.
  0. Go for it.
  0. Pace yourself.

## general

We use multiple services to get our work done:

  0. Trello (invite only) is how we track feature work
  0. Slack (invite only) is how we communicate


To get started you need to:

  0. Get an invite link to trello
  0. Get an invite link to slack


## engineering

As an engineer you'll probably be contributing to the services and apps. We also have a host of services that we use:

  0. For documentation we use gitbook.io
  0. For HTTP based services we use heroku.com
  0. For testing we use circleci.com
  0. For tasks we use github projets
  0. For bugs we use bugsnag.com
  0. For service analytics we use newrelic.com (via heroku)

We have multiple apps in the wild, they are:

  0. You can find the mvp here at https://github.com/Poutineer/mvp
  0. You can find the production http api here at https://github.com/Poutineer/origin
  0. You can find the production web here at https://github.com/Poutineer/web
